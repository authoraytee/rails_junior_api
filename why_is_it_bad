# Why does it work badly

- Note has no link to the diary in the model
- Expiration. Can be assigned only for private diaries - condition is not met
- Validation of fields is not in the database
- The deletion worker is fetching incorrectly. First, everything is loaded into memory, then it is filtered into it. It was necessary to use the capabilities of activerecord
- The environment is not used, the data for entering the sidekick is stored in the code
